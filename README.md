### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
ViewModel and Network Layer Integration: Since the RecipeViewModel interacts with the network service to fetch recipes and handles error states, it was essential to ensure the network layer is mocked effectively for unit testing. The focus was on making sure that the asynchronous data fetching logic was well-tested for both success and error scenarios.

UI Handling and Error States: I also prioritized the handling of empty states and error messages in the UI. This is crucial because, for users to interact with the application effectively, clear error messages and placeholders for empty lists are necessary. Ensuring that these UI states are properly displayed in the RecipesView was a key aspect of improving the user experience.



### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
The total time spent on this project was approximately 2-3 hours. The breakdown was as follows:

Network Layer Setup & Mocking (1 hours): This involved creating mocks for the network service (RecipeService) and ensuring that the HTTPClient decorator was testable.

ViewModel Implementation & Error Handling (1 hours): Time spent improving the RecipeViewModel to handle error cases and empty states, making it more testable by introducing helper methods like updateErrorMessage.

Writing Unit Tests (1 hours): Dedicated significant time to writing unit tests for different parts of the ViewModel and network service, mocking network calls and ensuring correct error handling and data parsing.



### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Yes, I made a few trade-offs:

Simplified Networking for Testability: In the network layer, I opted for a simpler HTTPClientDecorator to mock network requests. While this works for the scope of this task, a more robust approach with retry logic, request cancellation, and timeout handling could have been added for production-quality code.

Focus on Core Logic Over UI Polish: The UI handling (empty states and error messages) was a priority, but I did not spend as much time polishing the UI interactions or animations, as the focus was on ensuring the core logic and tests were working correctly.



### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The weakest part of the project would likely be UI polish and interaction tests. While the basic UI handling for empty states and errors is functional, there could be improvements in the interactivity, animations, and user experience (UX). Additionally, I could have written more extensive UI tests to simulate real user interactions (e.g., pull-to-refresh or navigating between screens).
